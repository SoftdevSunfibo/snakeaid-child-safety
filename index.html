  <h1>Snake Aid - Child Safety Standards</h1>
  <p>
    Snake Aid is committed to protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation. 
    Our app does not permit or tolerate any form of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and we actively work to prevent such content on our platform.
  </p>

  <h2>Our CSAE Prevention Practices:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do not allow user-generated content uploads beyond snake reporting (no chat, forums, or media sharing by users).</li>
    <li>All reports submitted through the app are reviewed internally for abuse or inappropriate content.</li>
    <li>Any suspected CSAM content is reported to relevant national and regional authorities.</li>
    <li>We comply with applicable child safety laws and Google Play Developer Program Policies.</li>
  </ul>
